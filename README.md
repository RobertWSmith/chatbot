# Flask LangGraph Chatbot

A Flask chatbot app with email/password auth, Postgres persistence, LangGraph chat streaming, OpenAI reasoning summaries, streaming Markdown, per-user settings, and user-approved long-term memory.

## Quick Start

1. Create and activate a Python 3.11+ virtual environment.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set:

   ```text
   SECRET_KEY=...
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://...
   LANGGRAPH_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
   OPENAI_API_KEY=...
   ```

4. Run migrations:

   ```powershell
   flask --app run.py db upgrade
   ```

5. Start the app:

   ```powershell
   flask --app run.py run
   ```

If `OPENAI_API_KEY` is empty, chat uses local demo streaming so the UI and auth flow can be tested without model calls.

## Memory

Long-term memory is deliberately user-approved. The agent can create pending proposals with `propose_memory`, but the memory is only written to the LangGraph store after approval from `/memory`.

## Reasoning

The app surfaces reasoning summaries when the configured model/provider supports them. It does not expose raw hidden reasoning.
